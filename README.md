# iphone_x_stand

I wanted a tidy charging solution for my iPhone X and Apple Watch Series 2 so created this stand.

## 3D Printing

|Part|Count|Material|Print Time|Supports|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|[charging_stand.stl](charging_stand.stl)|x1|88g|14 hours|No|
|**Total**| |**88g**|**14 hours**| |

* Printed on Ultimaker 2+ with Polymaker PolyMax PLA.
* 0.15mm layer height.
* Some stringing on overhangs in the back without supports, I don't mind it since out of sight, out of mind.
* You can use [charging_stand_no_watch.stl](charging_stand_no_watch.stl) if you don't need the watch stand.  Reduces print time to 7 hours and only uses 50g of material.

## Assembly

1. Fit the Gikfun Qi wire coil, wire side facing the phone, into the back of the stand.  I needed to secure it with a bit of electrical tape.
1. Fit the Gikfun Qi PCB into the studs on the base of the stand.  It should friction fit.
1. Pull the USB cable of the OPSO Apple Watch charger through the hole in the watch stand.  Orient the cable upwards into the channel cut for it, then press the charging base into the hole.  It may take a bit of force to pop in.
1. Plugin a micro-USB cable to the Gikfun Qi and plugin the apple watch charger.
1. Enjoy!

## Potential Improvements

* I think both chargers use less than 2.5amps.  They could be tied together so only one cord is needed.
